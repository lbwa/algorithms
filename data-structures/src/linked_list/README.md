# linked list

In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality compared to linked lists.

## benefits

The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk, while restructuring an array at run-time is a much more expensive operation. Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and allow doing so with a constant number of operations by keeping the link previous to the link being added or removed in memory during list traversal.

## Pseudocode

- [insert](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/linked-list#insert)

  ```
    Add(value)
    Pre: value is the value to add to the list
    Post: value has been placed at the tail of the list
    n ← node(value)
    if head = ø
      head ← n
      tail ← n
    else
      tail.next ← n
      tail ← n
      end if
    end Add
  ```

  ```
    Prepend(value)
    Pre: value is the value to add to the list
    Post: value has been placed at the head of the list
    n ← node(value)
    n.next ← head
    head ← n
    if tail = ø
      tail ← n
    end
    end Prepend
  ```

  ```
  Contains(head, value)
    Pre: head is the head node in the list
        value is the value to search for
    Post: the item is either in the linked list, true; otherwise false
    n ← head
    while n != ø and n.value != value
      n ← n.next
    end while
    if n = ø
      return false
    end if
    return true
  end Contains
  ```

- [delete](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/linked-list#delete)

  ```
  Remove(head, value)
    Pre: head is the head node in the list
        value is the value to remove from the list
    Post: value is removed from the list, true, otherwise false
    if head = ø
      return false
    end if
    n ← head
    if n.value = value
      if head = tail
        head ← ø
        tail ← ø
      else
        head ← head.next
      end if
      return true
    end if
    while n.next != ø and n.next.value != value
      n ← n.next
    end while
    if n.next != ø

        tail ← n
      end if
      n.next ← n.next.next
